# E2.S2 ElaadNL Set A shape report

## Scope

EV-004 Set A `quarantined_precriterion_diagnostic` batch: home charge-point profiles with the native car/van mix, simulated_year 2030, batch seed 141001, n_profiles 100. Raw and processed generated profiles are ignored and not redistributed under EV-002.

## Shape and timezone

- Timesteps: 35040
- Profiles: 100
- Distinct returned members: 100
- Returned indices available for planned pairing: True
- Smart pair order verified: False
- First UTC timestamp: `2024-12-31T23:00:00+00:00`
- First local timestamp: `2025-01-01T00:00:00+01:00`
- Last local timestamp: `2025-12-31T23:45:00+01:00`
- Missing/nonfinite values: 0
- Negative values: 0

## Summary statistics

- Annual energy kWh: min 1447.150, median 2027.000, mean 2025.676, p95 2385.335, max 2626.149
- Peak kW: min 11.000, median 11.000, mean 11.000, p95 11.000, max 11.000

## Seed semantics

Members are identified as `(batch seed, returned profile index)`. This report does not interpret a batch seed as a range of per-member seeds. Seed 140001 is reserved by EV-006 for a future same-seed smart-control counterpart, but no smart-control API call was made in this session. This uncontrolled-only probe leaves smart-batch member ordering unverified; actual pairing remains pending per section 7 of the Elaad profile generation spec.

## Source-level verdict

- API runtime seconds: 17.438
- API runtime note: Measured around the HTTPS POST only.
- Observed failed command wall time seconds: not recorded
- Supports proceeding to remaining candidate and held-out generation: True
- Library adequacy proven: False. Adequacy is an EV-005 downstream net-load/evaluator question, not a component-profile statistic.
